This code uses the CellularAutomaton function in the Wolfram Language to generate a 1-dimensional array of 0s and 1s that represents 
the evolution of the Rule 30 cellular automaton. The initial state of the automaton is a single 1 surrounded by 0s.

The resulting array is then plotted using the ArrayPlot function, which displays the array as a grid of black and white squares. 
The PixelConstrained option sets the size of each square, while the Mesh option adds grid lines to make it easier to see the individual cells of the automaton.

This code will generate a plot that shows the evolution of the Rule 30 automaton over 50 steps, according to the rule that governs 
the transition from one row to the next. The resulting plot should resemble the familiar triangle pattern that is characteristic of Rule 30.

rule30 = CellularAutomaton[30, {{1}, 0}, 50];
